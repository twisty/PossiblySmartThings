# (Possibly) SmartThings

## [Outside light](https://github.com/twisty/PossiblySmartThings/blob/master/smartapps/twisty/outside-light.src/)

A SmartApp that switches things on (like light bulbs) when any specified presence sensor arrives.

If a bulb was already on, it will increase the brightness to 100%.

After a configuarable number of minutes has elapsed, the switches / lights are restored to the state they were in before this SmartApp turned them on.
